          Arguably, snake season s year-round in Arizona, a state known for its
          rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in july and August, making
          these two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children
          and others at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites.

          So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to
          the Arizona poison and drug information center. Based at the
          University of Arizona College of pharmacy, the center serves the
          entire state of Arizona with the exception of Maricopa County,
          providing free and confidential poison and medication information to
          callers round the clock.Specialists anwering the phones receive calls
          from Arizonans of all ages who dont realize they have been bitten by a
          rattler. The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting,
          pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately call 800-222-1222."We will
          ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible
          snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona
          Poison and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the
          medical treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away
          can make a very big difference for the victims and the medical teams
          treating them."

          The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes
          to be aware of these five things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li type="circle">
            Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
            camouflaged by brush and grass.
          </li>
          <li type="circle">
            Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins,
            so there will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike
          </li>
          <li type="circle">
            Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very
            dangerous if they bite a human
          </li>
          <li type="circle">
            Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or
            while they are biting.
          </li>
          <li type="circle">
            It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an
            unidentified small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the
            lack of telltale rattle warning, people can be bitten without
            knowing what has happened until they notice their symptoms and
            attribute them to a snakebite.
